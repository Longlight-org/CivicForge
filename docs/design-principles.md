# CivicForge Design Principles


1. **Transparency First**
All proposals, discussions, and decisions are logged and accessible.


2. **Inclusive by Default**
CivicForge must be usable by people of different technical and cultural backgrounds.


3. **Reciprocity**
Open-source core under AGPL ensures that improvements benefit everyone. Commercial users can opt into tailored licenses that reinvest in the commons.


4. **Modular & Extensible**
Built so communities and companies can adapt it to their own needs without reinventing the wheel.


5. **AI as Assistant, Not Arbiter**
Machine learning helps summarize, cluster, and surface insights, but never overrides human judgment.


6. **Local First, Global Potential**
Start with pilots in Boise and Constellation Companies, but design with scalability to other contexts in mind.
