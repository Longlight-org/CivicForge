# CivicForge Overview


CivicForge is an open-source civic platform designed to help communities collaborate, deliberate, and decide together.
It is part of the Longlight ecosystem, stewarded by Longlight Inc. and supported by the Longlight Collective on Open Collective.


**Core Purpose:**
To provide transparent, participatory infrastructure for public and organizational decision-making.


**Primary Use Cases:**
- Public engagement: gather input on civic issues
- Organizational collaboration: enable "democracy of ideas" in Constellation Companies
- Participatory planning: prioritize projects and budgets


CivicForge is still in early development. Pilots are planned in Boise (tree canopy equity, transportation futures) and within Constellation Companies.
