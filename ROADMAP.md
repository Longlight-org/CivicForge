## Long-Term Vision (2–5 Years)
- A robust, trusted platform for participatory decision-making across civic and organizational contexts
- Open-source core maintained by **Longlight Inc.**, the nonprofit steward of the project
- Community support and funding through the **Longlight Collective** on Open Collective
- Dual-use: serving both public communities and Constellation Companies for internal innovation
- Sustainable funding model through commercial licensing and ecosystem pledges

**Guiding Principle:**  
CivicForge is built to illuminate better paths through collective intelligence. Whether in a city or a company, everyone should be able to propose ideas, deliberate together, and shape the direction of their community.
